# Chart Layout Optimization: Portfolio Overview Enhancement (IMPROVED)

## Problem Identified
The user reported that charts in the portfolio overview were not properly aligned and there was unused space that could be better utilized for the line chart display. After initial attempt, user feedback indicated the layout needed significant visual improvement.

## Solution Implemented (IMPROVED VERSION)

### 🎯 **Clean & Balanced Layout**
- **Changed to 5-column grid**: `lg:grid-cols-5` for better proportions
- **Optimal space distribution**: Balance info (2 columns) + Chart (3 columns)
- **Clean visual hierarchy**: Simplified and more professional appearance

### 📊 **Chart Enhancements**
- **Fixed height**: `h-[400px]` for consistent, prominent display
- **Better proportions**: Chart takes 60% of width on large screens
- **Proper header separation**: Clean border-separated header
- **Full chart utilization**: Chart uses remaining space efficiently

### 🎨 **Visual Improvements**
- **Single unified portfolio card**: Clean, organized 2x2 grid layout
- **Consistent typography**: Proper font weights and sizes
- **Better spacing**: Reduced gap from 8 to 6 for tighter composition
- **Professional aesthetics**: Clean, modern appearance

### 📱 **Responsive Design**
- **Mobile**: Single column stack with proper chart height
- **Large screens**: Balanced 2:3 ratio (info:chart)
- **Consistent experience**: Works beautifully across all devices
