- **Cache Management**: Visual health indicators, storage usage, refresh controls
- **Rate Limit Tracking**: Per-endpoint status with visual indicators and cooldown timers
- **Debug Logging**: Console capture with categorization, filtering, and export
- **Persistent State**: Position, visibility, logging preferences saved to localStorage

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Complete Developer Tool Unification
- **Before Phase 3**: 3 separate developer-focused components
  - DebugPanel: Debug logging and system monitoring
  - CacheStatusWidget: Cache management and visualization
  - RateLimitNotification: Rate limit status alerts
- **After Phase 3**: 1 unified UnifiedDeveloperPanel with all functionality integrated

### ✅ Enhanced User Experience
- **Draggable Interface**: Repositionable floating panel that doesn't interfere with main UI
- **Minimize/Maximize**: Space-saving controls for different use cases
- **Tabbed Organization**: Logical grouping of development information
- **Quick Status Overview**: At-a-glance system health in collapsed view

### ✅ Improved Functionality
- **Enhanced Logging**: 100 log history (vs previous 50), better categorization
- **Visual Rate Limits**: Progress bars and status indicators for all endpoints
- **Integrated Controls**: Cache refresh, cleanup, rate limit reset in one location
- **Export Capability**: JSON export of debug logs for analysis

### ✅ Reduced Complexity
- **Component Count**: Reduced developer tool components from 3 to 1
- **Import Dependencies**: Cleaned up unused imports across the application
- **State Management**: Centralized developer tool state in single component
- **Code Maintenance**: Single point of maintenance for all development features

## Technical Details

### Advanced Features
- **Console Interception**: Captures all console.log, console.warn, console.error calls
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatically categorizes logs by content (API, Cache, Rate Limit, Wallet, System)
- **Real-time Updates**: Live cache status and rate limit monitoring
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining functionality

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Log Management**: Circular buffer keeps memory usage constant
- **Lazy Rendering**: Hidden tabs don't render until accessed
- **Event Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of console overrides and event listeners
- **State Persistence**: Settings preserved across browser sessions

### Accessibility Improvements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all controls
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and accessible form controls
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear status indicators with color and icon coding
- **Responsive Touch**: Mobile-friendly drag and touch interactions

## Development Workflow Integration

### Usage Patterns
1. **Normal Development**: Panel minimized, quick status visible
2. **Debug Session**: Panel expanded, Logs tab active with filtering
3. **Performance Analysis**: Cache tab for storage and health monitoring
4. **API Investigation**: Limits tab for rate limit analysis
5. **System Overview**: Overview tab for quick status and actions

### Integration Points
- **WalletDashboard**: Can pass cache status and rate limit info
- **API Layer**: Rate limit information flows to unified display
- **Cache System**: Status and controls integrated into single interface
- **Local Storage**: Persistent configuration across sessions
