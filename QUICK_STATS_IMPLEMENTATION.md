# Quick Stats Implementation: Enhanced Portfolio Overview

## Feature Overview
Added a comprehensive Quick Stats section above the main tabs (Tokens, NFTs, Transactions, Analytics) to provide immediate insight into wallet performance and activity.

## Implementation Details

### 🎯 **Quick Stats Cards**
Added 4 key metric cards in a responsive grid layout:

1. **Total Transactions** (Blue Theme)
   - Shows total transaction count from wallet stats
   - Activity icon for visual clarity
   - Blue gradient background

2. **Received Amount** (Green Theme)
   - Displays total ALPH received
   - TrendingUp icon indicating incoming funds
   - Green gradient for positive association

3. **Sent Amount** (Orange Theme)
   - Shows total ALPH sent
   - TrendingDown icon indicating outgoing funds
   - Orange gradient for neutral/caution association

4. **Net Balance** (Purple Theme)
   - Calculates and displays net balance (received - sent)
   - Dynamic color: Green for positive, Red for negative
   - Shows with + or - sign for clarity
   - Wallet icon for balance indication

### 🎨 **Visual Design**
- **Gradient backgrounds**: Each card has a unique color theme
- **Icon integration**: Relevant icons in circular backgrounds
- **Responsive grid**: 2 columns on mobile, 4 columns on desktop
- **Loading states**: Skeleton placeholders while data loads
- **Consistent spacing**: Proper margins and padding

### 📱 **Responsive Layout**
```
Mobile (2 columns):
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Transactions│  Received   │
├─────────────┼─────────────┤
│    Sent     │ Net Balance │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘

Desktop (4 columns):
┌──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
│ Txns │ Recv │ Sent │ Net  │
└──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘
```

### 🔄 **Integration with Existing Data**
- Uses existing `walletStats` prop data
- Respects `isStatsLoading` state for loading indicators
- Consistent formatting with rest of application
- No additional API calls required
